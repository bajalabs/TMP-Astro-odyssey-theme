## Detailed Notes Per Task
### T2 Deletion
Paths to delete:
- `src/pages/solutions/page/[page].astro`
- `src/pages/industries/page/[page].astro`

### T4 Redirect Block (Optional)
See plan for snippet; ensure no trailing slash mismatch.

### T5 Documentation Guidance
Add rationale: “Unpaginated by design until content volume > threshold (e.g., > 25 items). At that point re-evaluate for performance + SEO list page depth.”

### T6 Inline Comment Example
```astro
<!-- Pagination intentionally omitted: keep full list; see PLAN_SOLUTIONS_INDUSTRIES_PAGINATION_CLEANUP.md -->
```

### T8 Verification Checklist
- No build warnings about missing routes.
- `/blog/page/1` still works (blog unaffected).
- 404 page shows for removed URLs.

### Risk Flags
If future taxonomy introduces slicing logic, ensure it doesn’t implicitly re-add pagination for these sections without explicit stakeholder buy‑in.
